# 🏰 REBEKA: Real Estate Blockchain Evolution & Key Assets
> **Pioneering Institutional RWA Tokenization for Mexico and LatAm on Arbitrum.**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

REBEKA is a decentralized protocol designed to transform high-value, illiquid real estate into fractionalized, compliant digital assets. By bridging the gap between traditional Mexican legal frameworks (**Fideicomisos**) and the efficiency of the **Arbitrum** ecosystem, we enable global investors to access the Latin American property market starting from 1 m².

Our mission is to provide a "Bank-Grade" security layer for landowners like Myriam, ensuring that physical assets are protected by code, law, and ZK-Identity.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **Institutional Compliance:** Powered by the **ERC-3643 (T-REX)** standard for automated regulatory enforcement.
* **Privacy-First KYC:** Integration with **Billions (Privado ID)** using Zero-Knowledge proofs to verify investors without compromising sensitive data.
* **Asset Recovery Protocol:** Built-in mechanisms to recover access to assets in case of lost keys, backed by the legal fiduciary structure.
* **Arbitrum Scalability:** Low-cost, near-instant settlement leveraging Ethereum's most robust Layer 2 security.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Network:** Arbitrum Sepolia / Orbit
* **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (OpenZeppelin) / Stylus (Rust)
* **Identity:** Billions ZK-Identity (Privado ID)
* **Security Standard:** ERC-3643
