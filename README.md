REBEKA: Real Estate Blockchain Ekosystem Arbitrum
REBEKA is a professional RWA (Real World Asset) infrastructure designed to scale land property tokenization. By bridging the Mexican legal framework with the Arbitrum network, we provide a robust platform for managing large-scale properties under a secure, permissioned, and transparent environment.

Our ecosystem is designed to support diverse real estate strategies through a modular approach, ensuring that each property asset is backed by institutional-grade technology and legal certainty.

🏗️ Core Infrastructure & Strategy
REBEKA is built to support three fundamental investment objectives, adaptable to each property’s specific needs:

EXIT (Liquidation): Streamlined tokenization for full asset sale and capital recovery.

GROWTH (Appreciation): Focused on long-term value increase through strategic land holding and development.

YIELD (Income): Designed for properties that generate recurring cash flow through operations or leasing.

Technical Foundation
RWAPermissionedERC20 Standard: We have developed a custom Permissioned ERC-20 layer. This architecture ensures that asset ownership is strictly governed by internal compliance logic. No transfer is executed unless the parties are verified within our registry, providing a sovereign and cost-efficient alternative for regulated assets.

Institutional Governance (Multisig): Fund management is secured via a Gnosis Safe Multisig. This "Human-in-the-loop" governance model ensures that all capital distributions—including property-specific reserves and owner payouts—are executed with multi-party oversight, aligning on-chain activity with the legal mandates of the property's Fideicomiso (Trust).

Survival Vault Concept: Every project within REBEKA integrates a dedicated reserve fund. This vault ensures the asset remains debt-free by covering long-term operational costs (such as taxes and maintenance) directly from the initial funding phase.

📂 REBEKAProjects Ecosystem
The REBEKA infrastructure is organized into specialized modules:

rebeka_contracts: The core protocol featuring the RWAPermissionedERC20 contract and role-based access control (RBAC).

FrontEnd: The professional investor gateway for onboarding, KYC synchronization, and asset management.

REBEKA (Root): High-level architectural documentation, legal-technical frameworks, and global ecosystem governance.

🚀 Buildathon Roadmap
V1 (Current): Full deployment of the Permissioned Token architecture and Multisig governance on Arbitrum Sepolia.

Phase 2: Optimization of the "Survival Vault" logic and integration of advanced reporting for institutional transparency.

Phase 3: Onboarding of the first large-scale pilot property under the Growth/Exit model.
