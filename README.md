# REBEKA: Real Estate Blockchain Ekosystem Arbitrum

**REBEKA** is a decentralized Real World Asset (RWA) protocol built on **Arbitrum Stylus**. We specialize in transforming high-value, illiquid land into liquid digital assets. Our mission is to provide land owners with an accelerated exit strategy while offering retail investors fractional access to premium real estate through a secure, legally-backed framework.

## 📍 Genesis Asset: Cerro del Chiquihuite
The protocol debuts with the tokenization of **20 hectares** in Puebla, Mexico.
* **Token Ticker:** `$RBK-CHIQ`
* **Full Name:** Real Estate Blockchain Ekosystem Arbitrum
* **Asset Ratio:** 1 Token = 1 $m^2$

## 🏗️ Key Pillars

### 1. Legal Trust (Mexican Fideicomiso)
The project is anchored by a **Mexican Irrevocable Trust (Fideicomiso)**. This legal vehicle:
* Segregates the land into an **autonomous patrimony**, protecting it from external liabilities.
* Acts as the binding bridge between Blockchain records and the Public Property Registry.
* Hardcodes a **"Sunset Clause"** for public auction if total liquidation isn't achieved by Year 10.

### 2. Financial Engineering (80/10/10)
REBEKA employs a sophisticated waterfall payment structure to align all stakeholders:

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Liquidation Pool** | **80%** | Dedicated to the original land owners for a full exit. |
| **Operational Reserve** | **10%** | Funds 10 years of property taxes, legal fees, and security. |
| **Team Incentives** | **10%** | Founders' pool with hybrid vesting and performance locks. |

### 3. Survival Vault (Priority Liquidity)
To ensure long-term viability, the first **$1,350,000 MXN** in sales are prioritized to fund the "Survival Vault." This ensures the project has a 12-month operational runway (Legal, Security, and Core Team) regardless of market conditions.

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation & Governance
* **Anti-Whale:** Maximum 10% token ownership per identity to prevent market manipulation.
* **Governance Cap:** Voting power is capped at 25% per identity to prevent hostile takeovers.
* **Sunset Clause:** Mandatory physical asset liquidation by the Trustee at Year 10 to protect investor capital from "dead-token" scenarios.
* **Inheritance Bridge:** Legal clauses for "Successor Beneficiaries" ensure capital flow isn't frozen by probate courts in the event of a holder's passing.
