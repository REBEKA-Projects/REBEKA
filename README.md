# 🏰 REBEKA: Real Estate Blockchain Ekosystem Arbitrum
> **Pioneering Institutional RWA Tokenization for Mexico and LatAm on Arbitrum.**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

REBEKA is a decentralized protocol designed to transform high-value, illiquid real estate into fractionalized, compliant digital assets. By bridging the gap between traditional Mexican legal frameworks (**Fideicomisos**) and the efficiency of the **Arbitrum** ecosystem, we enable global investors to access the Latin American property market starting from 1 m².

Our mission is to provide a "Bank-Grade" security layer for landowners like Myriam, ensuring that physical assets are protected by code, law, and ZK-Identity.

* **Asset Recovery Protocol:** Built-in mechanisms to recover access to assets in case of lost keys, backed by the legal fiduciary structure.
