REBEKA: Real Estate Blockchain Ekosystem Arbitrum
REBEKA is a comprehensive RWA (Real World Asset) infrastructure designed to digitize high-value real estate in emerging markets. By bridging Mexican legal structures with Arbitrum’s high-performance network, we transform "frozen" land into liquid, compliant digital assets.

This repository acts as the central hub for the REBEKA ecosystem, orchestrating the synergy between our financial engineering, legal compliance, and user interface.

📂 Project Structure
The REBEKA ecosystem is organized into specialized modules within the REBEKAProjects framework:

1. rebeka_contracts (The Protocol Core)
Architecture: Solidity / Hardhat.

Role: Manages the $REBK token lifecycle and the Automated Financial Waterfall.

Key Feature: Implements the 5.13% Survival Vault (10-year operational reserve) and the 85.87% Landowner Payout logic directly on-chain to ensure radical transparency and trustless execution.

2. FrontEnd (The Investor Portal)
Stack: React / Next.js / Tailwind CSS.

Role: The primary gateway for investors to browse tokenized hectares, complete KYC onboarding, and manage their fractionalized real estate portfolio.

Integration: Connects seamlessly with Arbitrum-compatible wallets (E.g., MetaMask, Rabby) to facilitate secure transactions.

3. REBEKA (Documentation & Governance)
Role: This current repository serves as the project’s high-level documentation, whitepaper storage, and governance framework.

Focus: It outlines the integration between the Mexican Irrevocable Trust and the blockchain registry, providing the legal-technical roadmap for institutional adoption.

🏗️ Core Innovations for the Buildathon
REBEKA solves the "RWA Friction" through three main pillars:

Smart Settlement: Our custom waterfall logic ensures that funds are never "stuck." Upon purchase, capital is automatically routed to the landowner and the maintenance reserves, eliminating human error in fund management.

Lightweight Compliance: We utilize a native Identity Allowlist to enforce KYC/AML regulations at the protocol level without the high costs of external standard licenses, making it viable for LATAM markets.

The Survival Vault: We solve the "dead-token" problem by pre-funding 10 years of property taxes and fiduciary fees, ensuring every $REBK token represents a debt-free asset.

🚀 Buildathon Roadmap
Phase 1 (MVP): Full integration of rebeka_contracts and FrontEnd on Arbitrum Sepolia.

Phase 2 (Scalability): Migrating core calculation modules to Arbitrum Stylus (Rust) to further reduce gas fees for retail investors.

Phase 3 (Expansion): Onboarding the first 20 hectares in Puebla, Mexico, as the Genesis Asset.
